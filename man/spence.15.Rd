\title{
Spencer's 15 point graduation rule.
}
\usage{
spence.15(y)
}
\description{
  Spencer's 15 point rule is a weighted moving average operation
  for a sequence of observations equally spaced in time. The
  average at time t depends on the observations at times t-7,...,t+7.

  Except for boundary effects, the function will reproduce
  polynomials up to degree 3.
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{Data vector of observations at equally spaced points.}
}
\value{
  A vector with the same length as the input vector, representing
  the graduated (smoothed) values.
}
\examples{
  data(spencer)
  yy <- spence.15(spencer$mortality)
  plot(spencer$age, spencer$mortality)
  lines(spencer$age, yy)
